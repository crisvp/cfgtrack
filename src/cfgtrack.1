.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cfgtrack
lets you add directories and files to a tracking list by keeping a seperate copy of the file in a tracking directory. When invoked with the 'compare' command, it outputs a Diff of any changes made in the configuration file since the last time you invoked with the 'compare' command. It then automatically updates the tracked file.

Remove <path> from the list of files to be tracked. <path> must be an absolute path to a file or directory.
